# Welcome to Pablo Souza's GitHub!

## About Me
Hello, I'm Pablo Souza, a Computer Science enthusiast on the verge of completing my bachelor's degree. With a solid background in backend development, I've been working with C# for the past two years, specializing in ASP.NET, Web APIs, and MVC projects.

## Interests and Hobbies 
I find joy in learning game development as a hobby, indulging in reading, and playing computer games. My passion for games extends to creating an app to enhance my football simulator gaming experience. As a career mode coach, I felt the need for better data tracking, and that's where my current project comes into play.

## Current Focus

üöÄ I'm currently developing [CleanSheet](https://github.com/souzapablo/cleansheet), an API to streamline data management for my football simulator game using .NET 8.0 and PostgreSQL.

‚öôÔ∏è Learning the ropes of Blazor to enhance my skill set and explore new avenues in web development.
